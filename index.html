			<h3>My Personal Journey</h3>
			
			<h4>How It All Began</h4>
			
			<p>From the beginning my main drive has come from the success my patients get from 
				Gonstead Chiropractic. Back when I was in Chiropractic school, I came across 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8Qo5BR3p8">this video</a>. The 17 year old 
				boy hadn’t been able to stand up in 3 months and could barely walk. No practitioner 
				could help him. After traveling to the opposite side of the globe to find a doctor 
				who could help him, he experienced such a quick and powerful recovery from what was 
				a hopeless circumstance. I fell in love with it and learned it was the Gonstead Method 
				of Chiropractic. That was when my life time study of the Gonstead System started. As 
				I learned more, I knew that mastering the Gonstead method as a licensed doctor was 
				what I wanted to do. By the 4th trimester, I fully dedicated myself to learning the 
				Gonstead method of Chiropractic. Little did I know how that decision would affect me 
				personally shortly there after.</p>
				
				<!-- <h3>A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</h3>
				
				<br>
				<p>In 2015, Amanda was diagnosed with epilepsy. With the new diagnosis came several seizures a month. During one of these seizures, she fell to the ground and hit her head on the floor. When she woke up, she was experiencing an intense migraine and her left eye was twitching. A few hours later, she experienced complete paralysis of her entire left side of her body. Thinking that she might be suffering from a stroke, I rushed her to the E.R. where they diagnosed her suffering from a hemiplegic migraine (a neurological condition that mimics a stroke with hemi-paralysis). They told Amanda that it would take her 6 months to learn how to walk again.</p>
				
				<p>Upon the last night of her being discharged, she was experiencing the worst migraine she had ever felt. She screamed for nurses to bring her pain medication, but she had already taken her daily dose. Knowing that Chiropractic can help headaches and migraines, I sat her down in a chair and began to assess her. I found that her C1 vertebrae had moved lateral to the right. At this point I told her that I was going to adjust it.</p>
				
				<h3>A Miracle</h3>
				<p>After the correction was made, Amanda's migraine had disappeared. About 30 seconds after the adjustment, she regained control of her face! Shocked &amp; amazed, I knew that this was a problem that Chiropractic could fix. After her adjustment the very next day, she immediately regained motor control of her arm! She was able to walk within a months time due to Gonstead Chiropractic! As I went to school, I heard miracle stories of how Chiropractic saved someone's life. I was skeptical about it until I actually got to witness it for myself via Amanda.</p>

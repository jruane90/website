			<h2>What Makes <u>PRODIGY CHIROPRACTIC</u> Unique?</h2>
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="regular-case">LET'S TALK ABOUT conventional CHIROPRACTIC FIRST...</h3>
			<p>The goals of conventional chiropractic are typically decreasing muscle spasm, increasing range of motion, and temporarily reducing pain.</p>
			<p>Most conventional chiropractors here in Dallas are EXCELLENT at obtaining their goals of managing many <b>secondary conditions (symptom)</b>.</p>
			<h3>Our objective is <b><u>different</u></b>.</h3>

			<h2>AT PRODIGY CHIROPRACTIC, WE FOCUS ON <u>FOUNDATIONAL CORRECTION</u></h2>
			<p>Your spine and nervous system are the foundation of your body and health.</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">Imagine your body as your house</h3>
			<p>What do you think would happen if your foundation had shifted?</p>
			<p>Floors begin to creak, drywall may crack, and windows wouldn’t open smoothly. You can put another nail in the floor to stop the creak and put putty in the drywall cracks, but these problems would continue to return until you addressed the cause – <b>the foundation</b>.</p>

				<h3>FOUNDATIONAL X-RAYS</h3>
				<p>Here at Prodigy Chiropractic, we utilize digital Foundational X-rays. Rather than taking x-ray shots of particular body regions, with Foundational X-rays, the doctor is able to see globally, the spine as a whole. We are able to see the foundation of your body (the pelvis) and take a look at how the spine compensate in order to keep the head balanced on top the body. The Foundational X-ray views the base of the skull down past the pelvis. We also do an extensive study and line drawing analyses to measure the extent of rotation in the pelvis and are able to see exactly where and how each vertebrae needs to be contacted in order to deliver a perfect adjustment.</p>
				
				<h3>WHY THE USE OF X-RAYS IN CHIROPRACTIC?</h3>
				<p>A Chiropractor's job is to find the location of nerve interference or a "pinched nerve" due to a bone being out of place. To remove the pinched nerve, the Chiropractors moves the bone back into it's proper alignment. Dealing with bones in the body, it's best to actually see whats going on with a patient's spine rather than just "shooting in the dark". The concept is simple. Would you go to a podiatrist who doesn't ask you to remove your shoes? Would you go to a dentist who doesn't take a look inside of your mouth?</p>

			<h2>YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITY</h2>
			<p>Prodigy Chiropractic holds a <b>certificate of good standing</b> with the Gonstead Clinical Studies Society, so you can be assured we are the your local authority on the gold standard of chiropractic.</p>
			
			<h3>THE GONSTEAD ANALYSIS</h3>
			<p>X-rays are only a part of the Gonstead System which requires years of training and applied knowledge to perform.</p>
			<div class="two-section">
				<div class="section-half">
					<h3>VISUALIZATION</h3>
					<p>Visualization is a way to cross reference all the other findings. Your chiropractor is an expert in looking for subtle changes in your posture and movement which could indicate any problems.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-half">
					<h3>MOTION PALPATION</h3>
					<p>This process involves feeling the spine while moving and bending it at various angles. This enables the chiropractor to determine how easily or difficult each segment in your spine moves in different directions.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="two-section">
				<div class="section-half">
					<h3>INSTRUMENTATION</h3>
					<p>The instrument of choice in the Gonstead System is the Nervoscope. The Nervoscope detects uneven distributions of heat along the spine which can be indicative of inflammation and nerve pressure. This instrument is guided down the length of your back and feels like two fingers gliding down each side of your spine.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-half">
					<h3>STATIC PALPATION</h3>
					<p>This is simply the process of feeling (or palpating) your spine in a stationary (or static) position. Your chiropractor will feel for the presence of swelling (or edema), tenderness and any abnormal texture or tightness in the muscles and other tissues of your back.</p>

			<h3>WHY DON'T ALL CHIROPRACTORS PRACTICE GONSTEAD?</h3>
			
			<p>The Gonstead analysis takes more time and mastering the art of delivering specific adjustments takes a LOT of practice and dedication. Without the dedication required to learn the Gonstead System, your doctor will pop random bones and pray they got it right. Amazingly, this can help some people but it can't help as many people or provide longer lasting adjustments.</p>
			<p>Often chiropractors who don't exclusively practice the Gonstead System make more money. Their patients come in to get adjusted more often (everyday for months). The symptoms might go away for a while, but nothing has really been healed. The chiropractor who doesn't practice the Gonstead method cashes in with too many appointments and more bad work.</p>
			<p>Chiropractors don't make as much money as you might think, but here at Prodigy Chiropractic we earn the food on our table the honest way. We sleep well because we have invested the diligence to learn the Gonstead System and our patients know our honesty because we educate them about their condition and how to best treat it.</p>

				<h3>DR. CLARENCE S. GONSTEAD (1898-1978)<br>
					<span>Creator of the Gonstead System</span>
				</h3>
				<p>He was a pioneer in the field of chiropractic, and the founding father of the Gonstead System of Chiropractic. His personal experience with chiropractic healing him from rheumatoid arthritis and his background in mechanical engineering gave him a unique approach. His "foundation principle" was based on a detailed examination and study of the spinal system. He proposed that rotation, twisting of the spine, manipulation of the neck or cervical spine in chiropractic practice was harmful to the patient with potential complicated consequences, such as a stroke. Aiming to avoid such complications, Gonstead developed his own system of chiropractic.</p>
				<p>As a chiropractor and mechanical engineer, Gonstead leveraged his skills and expertise to develop cutting-edge chiropractic equipment. His methodology of analysis uses more than one criteria such as x-ray analysis, instrumentation, static palpation, motion palpation, and visualisation to verify the precise location of the vertebra misalignment. Gonstead’s principle was “find the misalignment, accept it where you find it, correct it, and leave it alone.” The common sense, evident in his work, is further summarised in another phrase that he often used: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>
				<p>The Gonstead System of Chiropractic represents the ultimate in “hands on” spinal adjusting and remains among the foremost of chiropractic techniques. Dr. Gonstead’s reputation spread far and wide, and he received hundreds of patients from all over the world. In 1964, he built the largest chiropractic clinic in the world in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin.</p>

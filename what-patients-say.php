					<p>I have been seeing Dr. Ruane for the past couple weeks. I thought I had a clear knowledge of chiropractors, as I see them quite regularly, but Dr. Ruane blew me away. Joe is honestly the best chiro I have ever been to in my life. He takes a very methodical, specific approach to each patient. He finds the foundation of the issue and works to correct that first. I have been dealing with back issues for 12 years and have seen several chiros. All, except Joe, have treated only the symptoms and not the underlying issue. I am so grateful that I have found him. I would highly recommend him to anyone. I live in South Dallas and make the commute to see him, which speaks for how much respect and trust I have in him. Definitely my permanent chiropractor from now on.</p>

					<p>EXTREMELY IMPRESSED - Best Chiropractor in Mckinney!!! Having a weired back pain that i have never had and coincidentally meeting Dr. Ruane at a networking group around same time my back started hurting, i decided to go see Dr. Ruane. I have gotten the services of several chiropractors before and most of them would start adjusting me right away and i could never understand what they were trying to fix on my back and their services were not great. Dr. Ruane started by educating me about the spine, checked pressure points and pain points on my back, made notes, took pictures of me standing. Dr. Ruane immediately identified the problem, but to be sure, Dr Ruane wanted me to get X-Rays done. Once i got the X-Rays, Dr. Ruane explained to me what he saw and how he can fix my back. He adjusted me and i immediately felt releif from back pain. Very impressed with with Dr. Ruanes professionalism, his great knowledge and passion about Chiropractic and helping people live pain free from back pain. I highly recommemd Dr. Ruane for Chiropractic services. His prices are very good as well.</p>

					<p>Dr. Joe really cares for his patient more than any other doctor I have seen. He took his time to really listen to me and only did exactly what I needed. He didn't throw any of that extra unnecessary stuff that most doctors do to add more to your bill. He genuinely cares about your issues and makes sure you get the most out of your experience to actually feel better for good, not just schedule you to come in as often as possible. <br>
						His style of chiropractic is different but soooo much better because it follows real science and mechanics that actually helped me like no other medical physician or chiropractor I had seen about my complicated migraine issues before.<br>
						Most doctors wasted my time and money after scheduling so many in and out rushed visits, Dr. Joe got rid of my pain after my first adjustment and told me his goal was to see me as little as possible because he wants me to live healthy and pain free for as long as possible. If you actually want to feel better faster, then Prodigy chiropractic has got to be your only stop.

					<p>Okay, kids.  Let me let you in on a huge secret....in our house we call him Chiro Joe.  I also refer to him as the wizard.  One day I randomly complained about foot pain and 2 minutes later it was gone.  Wizard.  Now feet and chiropractors were not two things I put together in my mind.  I thought it was back and back alone.  Joe Ruane @ Prodigy Chiropractic  practices the method of gonstead chiropractics.  I admit, I am someone who thought traditional chiropractics was more like voodoo and now in a total 180 - I'm vouching for the Gonstead Method.  Specifically, Joe Ruane.  He doesn't just help my back.... he helps my back, neck, hips, feet, shoulder, my husband's nose to make his snoring go away and so much more.  He doesn't upsell you on things, either.   This isn't the place that makes you come every single day for 4 weeks.  Even with my out of whack hips... it works and it's pretty much instant.  Wizard.  He's to the point.  He's clear.   My husband and I both agree, we find him genuine.  If he wasn't our doctor he's the kind of guy you would invite to family birthday parties.  An all around good guy and excellent professional.</p>

					<p>I got an MRI and was told I have a bulging disc in the lower part of my back. They said I was a candidate for surgery, but the ball was in my court. I wanted to avoid surgery at all cost so we talked to Dr. Ruane about my situation and he explained his technique and how he could help. After a pretty intense flare up, we reached out to him and he was able to see me last minute. I walked in his office limping and in a lot of pain, but shortly after, I walked out with no limp and in no pain. Thank you so much Dr. Ruane!</p>

					<p>I got in a bad car accident which left my back and neck in horrible shape. Joe not only worked with my super busy schedule but he also did some of the most solid chiropractic work I've ever had done. I've been to a ton of chiropractors for multiple different injuries, but I've never had somebody with the knowledge or skills that Joe possesses. I'd recommend him to absolutely anyone. Oh, and my neck and back have never felt better!</p>

					<p>I’ve had the pleasure of getting to be adjusted by Dr. Joe back when he was in student clinic up until just recently before having to leave the Dallas area. He is super specific and gentle with his adjustments and is definitely the go to doctor for your chiropractic needs. His use of the Gonstead technique is truly an altogether different chiropractic experience!</p>

					<p>I've been struggling with migraines for a few weeks before I went to go see Dr. Ruane. A friend of mine recommended that I go see a chiropractor before I went to go see my doctor.<br>
						Dr. Ruane was professional and informative as he showed me where my pain was stemming from and how best to alleviate it. He even had a chart where he helped me see exactly what nerve was causing my headaches.<br>
						After taking my X-Rays and a few visits, I no longer have migraines at all. I now go see Dr. Ruane on a regular basis to go and get adjusted. I highly recommend Dr. Ruane and his practice.

					<p>This past December while working out, I pulled something in my mid-back. I could put on my shirt, or just breath without feeling pain in my back. I went and saw my old Chiropractor and I left feeling worst! I decided to see Dr. Joe. He uses a different technique (Gonstead I believe), that finds the exact place of a pinched nerve. When I saw him, he was able to find my problem area and adjust it. It only took 2 visits of seeing Dr. Joe before I was back in the gym and working out. I can't express enough how grateful I am with his amazing work. I highly recommend him!</p>
